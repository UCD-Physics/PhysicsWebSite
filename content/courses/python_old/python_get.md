## Python 3

Python 3 is the [officially-supported](https://www.python.org) version and is the one that should be used. There are different releases of Python 3 (e.g. 3.8) and it is recommened to use the most recent release, but in particular a release of 3.6 or later.  Python 2 was officially [sunset](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) in early 2020. 

{{% alert warning %}}
A lot of basic Python 3 code will run in Python 2 but subtle differences can cause unexpected behaviour, especially with division of integers!
