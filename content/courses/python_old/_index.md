## Why Python?
[Python](https://www.python.org) is a computer programming language that is becoming increasingly popular
in Physics. It is easy to learn and has a quite user-friendly syntax. There are also
an incredible range of libraries availabe for it, making it a very easy and powerful language to use
to tackle a range of problems.

Several years ago the staff of the Advanced Physics Laboratories replaced three software packages/languages
(C++, MATLAB, and MATHCAD) that were used with Python, allowing data aqcuisition, data analysis and computational
physics to be done with the one language. In addition, the module ACM 20030 Computational Science, core for all
Physics students, is delivered through Python and a new first-year module "Computation for Scientists" is under
development to run in 2021-2022.

The aim of this section of the web site is to provide a centralised place for UCD Physics students to access
reference material, advice, and hints and tips on using Python to solve problems and analyse and present
data in their lecture and laboratory courses.
